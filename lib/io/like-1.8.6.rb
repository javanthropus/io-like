class IO # :nodoc:
  # This module provides most of the basic input and output functions of
  # <code>IO</code> objects as implemented in Ruby version 1.8.6.  Its use is
  # supported on all versions of Ruby.  See the general documentation of
  # <code>IO::Like</code> for a description of how to create a class capable of
  # using this module.
  #
  # Include this module explicitly rather than <code>IO::Like</code> if the
  # including class should always behave like Ruby 1.8.6 <code>IO</code> no
  # matter what version of Ruby is running the class.
